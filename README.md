Created a clone of the classic Pong game for my game programming class. 
Made the game playable by two players. Player 1 uses the W and S keys while Player 2 uses the up and down arrow keys.
The ball speeds up every time it's hit, capping when it reaces twice its original speed.
Added 3 powerups: increase ball size, decrease ball size, and spawn new ball.
